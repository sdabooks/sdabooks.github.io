<p>What had been as solid as polished glass
a moment before was now flowing away from the unconscious maiden like
water, quickly leaving her unsupported. The outer layer was gone, and
the inner layers were dissolving. He could see the bottom of the
crystal, now a puddle on the floor, as thin streams ran off the edges
of the platform into the pool below.</p>
<p>As she collapsed forward in a waterfall
of blue-green rivulets, he thrust his arms out without thinking and
caught her in his arms, marvelling at how little she weighed. She
slumped against him, her head cushioned on one arm, and he could feel
the warmth of her body as he held her, and the soft movement of her
breathing. He was struck suddenly by how fragile she felt, how delicate
and vulnerable.</p>
<p>She was beginning to stir. Gently,
carefully, he lowered her down to the surface of the platform before
stepping back to allow her to awaken in her own time.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the light was fading. The
liquefied crystal was flowing down the sides of the platform, steadily
losing its radiance as it merged with the waters surrounding it.
Corsten fumbled for his tinder box, then re-lit his lantern to drive
back the gathering darkness.</p>
<p>The warm glow of the lantern illuminated
the mysterious girl's face, and bestowed a much greater appearance of
vitality upon her than had the spectral crystalline effulgence. The
gown clung to her body as if it were part of it. She was beautiful to
behold, like the sleeping goddess of the traditional ballad of Tula
Ranivara. Her hair looked like frozen strands of spun moonlight, with
curling tresses that framed her face, and he imagined himself reaching
down and running his fingers through it, feeling its silken texture as
it flowed around his hand and over his fingers.</p>
<p>His heart fluttered with questions which
nagged at him for an answer, but which he could not know: <em><span
class="s2">Who is she? What kind of magic had imprisoned her? </span></em>His
gaze upon her was filled with sorrow for her plight,
and with a desperate longing. He tried to banish such thoughts from his
mind as she lay there helpless before him; tried not to desire her,
knowing he was not worthy of such a woman, that he could not be
desirable to her &mdash; but as he sat there his mind kept wandering back to
thoughts about how lovely she was, and how much he yearned to have the
love of such a woman for himself. But it could not be.</p>
<p class="p3"><br>
</p>
<p>It was a long moment before she stirred
again. Corsten saw her pale-blue eyes flutter open, and settle upon
him. She stared at the rough-hewn face of her liberator for a moment,
frowning uncertainly. Corsten sheathed his sword and knelt beside her
once more. He showed her his empty hands in indication of peaceful
intent. "What has happened to you?" he asked, leaning forward on his
knee. "Is there anything I can do to help?"</p>
<p>There was a look of confusion in her
eyes as she struggled to sit up. "Hvara urdhi?" she asked, hastily
adjusting her gown. "S&uacute; irth eghet aunn ath barestinur!"</p>
<p>Her voice was sweet and musical like
that of a lark, unaffected by the ponderous length of her enchanted
slumber; the words she spoke were foreign, but Corsten could understand
them, with some difficulty. She was speaking in Suevic, a tongue that
he knew well from the year and a half that he had spent in that
distant, frozen land, and yet it was no dialect that Corsten had ever
heard in his travels. There was an unusual formality to her words, and
her pronunciation was curious &mdash; some of the vowels were transposed, she
enunciated each consonant, and some of the hard consonants were swapped
with soft ones &mdash; but it was comprehensible nonetheless. <em><span
class="s2">Who are you?</span></em> she had asked. <em><span
class="s2">You are not one of the priests!</span></em></p>
<p>Corsten offered her his hand, and helped
her sit up. "I am Corsten Rieder," he said in her language, doing his
best to imitate her unusual accent. "I found you here, and freed you
from your crystalline prison."</p>
<p>"Corsten?" she repeated his name
tentatively, as if trying it on for size, testing it against her
knowledge of the world around her. "I am Kala," she replied in that
strange tongue, her voice level, though her eyes were wide and
wondering. "Of the House of Onorema."</p>
<p>"Kala..." he said quietly. It was a
pretty name, he thought. It seemed to fit her well. It felt right on
his lips, as if he'd known it his whole life. That sense of longing
began to return, and he fought to push it away again. "And how came you
here?" he asked.</p>
<p>She stared at him in confused silence
for a long moment, her face blank, but then her brow furrowed. "It was
the wicked priests of the Trickster," she said. "The god that they call
Shusi-Gishkim. Is this name known to you?"</p>
<p>"I know of him," Corsten said, frowning,
thinking of the figurine that had brought him to her prison, and he
tried to hide the unease he felt at her wrathful tone toward the thing
that had saved his life.</p>
<p>"The priests of their cult came in the
night," she said, her tone low but even, anger creasing her pretty
forehead. "They stole me from my home, away from my family, and brought
me here as a prisoner in chains."</p>
<p>"What?" cried Corsten, and was on his
feet in an instant, looking down incredulously at the seated maiden,
his fists clenched. "Stolen? For what reason would they kidnap you?"</p>
<p>There was a strange fire in her eyes as
she spoke of those who had made themselves her enemies. "They made an
offering of me," she said. "The priests believed that the Chaos Lord
would be pleased with me for my affinity for the storm and the tempest.
It is a gift that many in my family were granted, for those of my line
are beloved of the Archon of the Winds." She stared off sullenly into
the gloom, bitterness evident on her face.</p>
<p>"And they <em><span class="s2">abducted</span></em> you for this
gift," Corsten growled in disgust. <em><span class="s2">Taken against
her will, away from her loved ones, away from
those who would court her if they could...</span></em></p>
<p>"They did," she said darkly. But she
looked up at him again, and her expression softened. She leaned forward
and moved to rise, and he hastened to help her to her feet, mindful of
the unsteadiness she seemed to bear from being suspended in unlife by
the crystal's magic. She found her balance and stood tall, offering him
a small smile. "But you have freed me. Thank you."</p>
<p>It was a simple expression of gratitude,
but its effect went deep. He smiled then, and nodded. "Yes. Your
solitude has ended." But he was conscious that her gratitude was
premature. He glanced back at the door through which he had entered,
still open and showing nothing but darkness beyond, and toward the
doors on the other walls of the chamber, thinking of what may lay
beyond them, and what they may need to cross before she would truly be
free. The task had seemed odious before, but now that he was no longer
alone he wanted nothing more than to see the sun again, and to help
this maiden see it too. "We must leave this place," he said. "It is not
safe here."</p>
<p>She stretched then, slowly working out
the kinks and stiffness in her arms and legs left over from her long
slumber. It was a slow, luxurious movement that attracted Corsten's eye
and held it fixed. His gaze burned with intensity as he drank in every
detail of her face: the aquiline nose; the elegant eyebrows; the plump
lips; the smooth skin; that strange silvery-pale hair, shimmering in
the light of his lantern... And then he dared to look lower, at the
womanly form he had admired freely while she slept, now full of
vitality where before it had been frozen like a statue. He could not
help but notice the firm swell of her breasts beneath the clinging
material of her gown; it was an exotic garment, unlike anything he had
seen before, and yet it seemed to be well suited to its wearer's body.
Against his better judgement, he allowed his gaze to roam lower, to
admire the supple curves of her bare calves as she flexed them deeply
and sensuously.</p>
<p>It was not long before Kala noticed his
silent regard. She looked curiously at him for a moment, and then
understanding dawned on her face. Though surprised by his boldness, a
hint of smile danced on her lips, and she stood up straight and began
to appraise him as openly as he had done. She regarded him with a mock
critical air, her gaze lingering first on his rugged features, then to
his brawny arms, over his broad chest, and then down his armoured torso
and still lower toward his groin, where it remained a little too long
for his comfort. He turned his head aside as if stung. He had
embarrassed her, and she had turned it upon him.</p>
<p>She tilted her head and laughed softly,
and came up to him and touched his arm. "Do not be ashamed," she
chided, "for I am not. I am pleased that you find me so fascinating."</p>
<p>Corsten gave a brief chuckle in reply,
and shook his head. "It is hard not to be fascinated," he said. "I
could not have expected to find such beauty in this place." By her
smile, he could tell that this pleased her.</p>
<p>"You speak my language very well, but
like none I have heard before," she said, and studied him anew. "Your
accent, your choice of words... I do not know where you are from, but
you are clearly no Merisolan."</p>
<p>Corsten had been about to answer her
implicit question, to tell her where he was from, but her final word
stopped him short. He thought at first that he must have misheard her,
or that his inexpert grasp of her language had failed him here, for why
would she compare him to an <em><span class="s2">Merisolan,</span></em>
unless...</p>
<p>"You... are from Merisolis?" he finally
blurted.</p>
<p>"Naturally," she said in amusement,
tilting her head and looking at him quizzically. "Why would that
surprise you so, when you are speaking our language?"</p>
<p>Her words caused Corsten's heart to skip
a beat. He stared at her, his mind reeling at the revelation. <em><span
class="s2">Merisolis!</span></em> That enlightened
nation of great learning and power, destroyed in a great cataclysm and
lost to the centuries, little more now than myth and legend that few
yet believe. It had been a shining beacon of civilisation, an island of
culture and learning, full of strange magic and cunning fabrications of
crystal and brass that had enriched and ennobled the lives of its
people. No one today gave credence to the boasts of the people of
Suevia, who claimed to be their distant descendants, but here was a
woman of exotic countenance speaking an unknown Suevic dialect,
claiming to be Merisolan with such guileless honesty that there was no
question of doubting her. He thought again of the great antiquity of
the very temple in which they now stood, and was struck with a renewed
sense of awe. <em><span class="s2">Yes,</span></em> he mused. <em><span
class="s2">When this place was
new, Merisolis would not yet have fallen.</span></em></p>
<p>"But this is fantastic!" he said,
grasping her small hand in excitement. "A living survivor of Merisolis!
There is so much that our historians do not know of that time and that
place that you could tell us!"</p>
<p>"A survivor?" she said suddenly, a sharp
tone of alarm in her melodious voice. She shook her head and fixed wide
eyes upon him. "What do you mean?" She suddenly pulled her hand from
his as comprehension &mdash; and the beginnings of despair &mdash; dawned on her
features. "Has... has something happened to my homeland?"</p>
<p>He gazed on her with dismay. The
terrible realisation came to him, striking him like a hammer blow. How
thoughtless a thing he had done! What he in his artlessness had thought
a cause for celebration was to her an unthinkable tragedy. She had
slept through the end of Merisolis, and now she was awake in a new age,
in a world that knew nothing of her people's heart-shattering fate.
"I..." he stammered, suddenly at a loss for words. How could he tell
her? He turned away to hide his face from
her desperately searching gaze. "Do... do not make me tell you this,"
he said falteringly.</p>
<p>"What is it?" she cried, now grasping
his arm in her distress. "What has happened? Please, I must know!"</p>
<p>He turned back to face her and tried to
speak, but the words caught in his throat and his voice failed him.
Corsten had never been good at concealing his emotions from others, and
the damage had already been done. He could not hide the truth from her,
as it was written plainly on his own countenance, and so he took a deep
breath and set himself to his lamentable task. He placed a hand on her
shoulder, and she did not resist his touch. "Yes..." he said haltingly.
"I'm afraid there was a..." He nearly looked away from her again, but
forced himself to hold her anxious gaze, no matter how it pained him.
"A tragedy."</p>
<p>"Please, no! You cannot mean it!" Her
voice was frantic now, close to breaking with dismay, and her eyes were
bright with tears. "Tell me that it is not so!"</p>
<p>Corsten felt the hot sting of tears
forming in his own eyes as he witnessed her distress, a pain and sorrow
unaffected by the ages that had passed her by. His heart broke for her.
He squeezed her shoulder gently, and wiped his eyes with the back of
his other hand. "I am so sorry," he said in a husky whisper. He looked
full into her shocked face, swallowing hard around a painful lump in
his throat as he saw that she understood full well the implications of
his words. He cleared his throat and tried again. "It has been nearly a
thousand years," he said hoarsely. "And your land has fallen."</p>
<p>"A thousand...?" Her voice was small.
She closed her eyes against those terrible words and sank to her knees,
her lips pressed tightly together.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, Kala," he whispered gravely,
and moved to sit down beside her. "No one knows exactly what happened,
only that there was a great cataclysm, and when it had ended, Merisolis
was no more. I fear that you are the last &mdash; the last of that beautiful,
wonderful civilisation. I am so sorry."</p>
<p>A terrible silence followed. Kala knelt
unmoving for a long moment, her face an unreadable mask. Then a shudder
ran through her delicate frame. Her shoulders heaved and a choked sob
came from her quivering lips. She lowered her head as her shoulders
shook with grief, and then she fell into his arms, weeping bitter tears
into his broad chest as she accepted the awful truth.</p>
<p>Corsten felt sick with anguish. He
wrapped her in his embrace and held her gently, cradling her as she
wept at the loss of her homeland. Her slender hands came up and found
his shoulders, then held on tightly as she buried her face into his
chest. He stroked her long silvery hair and murmured soothing
endearments, but his words sounded hollow in his own ears. Words were
such feeble solace in the face of loss and grief.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry," he murmured once more,
rocking her in the shelter of his arms, but inwardly he cursed himself
as a traitor. Why had the cruel task fallen to him to perform, to bring
her such misery and heartache? Everything she had ever known had been
taken away from her in an instant, without warning. Why had he been
compelled to bring her out of her rest, alone and displaced in time,
into a world with nothing &mdash; absolutely nothing &mdash; to anchor her to her
former life? If only he had never discovered her crystal prison &mdash; had
never known about this temple in which it stood. He would never have
ventured here, and she would still be sleeping peacefully until the end
of time, forever shielded from the doleful burden she now endured.</p>
<p>Kala clung to him, shaking with emotion
in his steady embrace. Her grief was overwhelming, and it made Corsten
feel so helpless, so utterly inadequate. He offered what comfort he
could, wishing desperately that he could take some of it onto himself
and ease her suffering, but he could not. He held her close, speaking
words of comfort, sharing in her sorrow, but all the while he fought
with the tempest that raged in his heart &mdash; the tempest of guilt he felt
for having brought this tragedy into her life.</p>
<p>As they held each other there on the
petal-strewn platform where the crystal prison had once stood, Corsten
reflected on his own sorrows, now seeming so distant and unimportant.
His exile, the loss of his wealth and status, the shame he had brought
to his noble house &mdash; all faded into insignificance beside her woe. He
was a man with nothing to his name, but at least those he had known and
loved yet lived, while her people were gone, their unique culture wiped
from the face of the world. She was alone in a world that had changed
beyond recognition during her long slumber.</p>
<p>No &mdash; he could not allow that to be. She
would not be alone. He would not leave her stranded in this strange new
world. They would leave this place together, and he would take her
anywhere she wished to go. Perhaps in time he could find a way to bring
comfort to her grief, and find a place for her to belong. He knew in
his heart that it was the only thing left for him to do. Without
knowing it, Kala had given him a reason to go on, something to live
for. His own sense of loss and sorrow seemed more bearable by the
thought of sharing that journey with this silver-haired vestige of the
ancient world.</p>
<p>Kala's gentle weeping echoed from those
ancient walls like the ghostly remnants of the lives they had both
lost, and they huddled there together in their need; two lonely souls
cast adrift on a sea of grief, lost in a world that had no place for
them to call home.</p>
