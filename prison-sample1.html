<p>Corsten had little idea of what he was looking for
until he found it; the tell-tale traces of ancient wards and magical
runes carved into the surface of the stone floor. He had no idea what
they meant, or what purpose they might have, but he was certain that
they would provide him with some clue to understanding this strange
temple and its mysteries. He double-checked his gear, then, lantern in
hand, he began to follow the mysterious etchings.</p>
<p>He moved carefully, hand on the hilt of
his sword as he shifted from one tiny landing to the next, listening
intently for any sign of the monstrous guardians from before.</p>
<p>Corsten stopped at a junction in the
path, near what looked to be a stairway leading up to an enclosed
landing, but the stairs were broken and crumbled, with shards of grey
stone and quartz strewn everywhere. There were archways to either side
of it, and some intact stairs leading down, but the curious markings on
the floor led past them and toward another archway at the other end of
the hall, so he continued on. He followed them to a place where the
carvings and glyphs were sharper and more intricate than elsewhere, and
his eyes were drawn to a surreal light that shone like a beacon at the
end of the hall, gradually growing in intensity as he approached it.
The dust on the floor here was thick and undisturbed. Nothing had
passed this way for a long time.</p>
<p>Soon he saw in front of him two large
ornate doors; they stood ajar with a strange blue-green light spilling
through them into the dimly lit corridor. The eerie glow now provided
ample light to see by, and he extinguished his lantern to preserve its
fuel.</p>
<p>Corsten reached the threshold of the
ornate doorway and peered cautiously into the chamber lit by the eerie
blue-green light. The only sound was that of his own breathing. The
answer to this riddle must be hidden here.</p>
<p>At first he did not see the source of
the light. The chamber was large and cylindrical, with great pillars
rising up to a domed ceiling. To the far left and right were two large
bronze doors, each decorated with the same intricate patterns as the
entrance door and depicting great beasts, presenting an impressive
sight. The walls were brilliantly coloured, the upper portions a deep
blue and the lower sections a pale blue-green, with intricate patterns
in the white-plaster coating. Nothing was here to oppose him. Indeed,
there was no sign that the temple guardians ever patrolled these halls,
yet still he kept his sword at hand. With a deep breath, he stepped
into the chamber, his senses alert and heightened. </p>
<p>The light intensified around him,
bathing him in its soft radiance as he ventured inside, until he
rounded the side of one of the room's colossal pillars, and his breath
caught in his throat as he sighted its source.</p>
<p>In the centre of the room was a large
pool of still water, ringed with smooth stones, and from within that
pool rose a stepped platform at whose summit stood the source of the
light: a great faceted crystal, at least ten feet tall, standing
upright upon the platform like a massive obelisk. The light emanated
from somewhere deep within its heart, and seemed to pulse slowly with
its own strange rhythm, suffusing the room in its uncanny luminescence.
</p>
<p>He took a few hesitant steps toward the
crystal, holding his sword at the ready. It dazzled his eyes with its
brightness, and it wasn't until he approached nearer that he could see
that there was a figure encased within the crystal, floating in its
centre. It was a young woman who stood motionless, frozen in mid-air
like a captured spirit. Her arms were raised gracefully over her head,
and she wore a tranquil expression, eyes closed and head thrown back.
She was beautiful and exotic, with strange pale hair the colour of
high-altitude ice, falling about her head and body in a smooth wave
like swirls of frozen dancers.
Looking at this frozen woman reminded him of home: her hair was like
the lightning storms that used to gather on the horizon in the twilight
of dusk; her pale skin was like the winter snowfall in the countryside,
where once there had been laughter and merriment. </p>
<p>She was frozen in time, somehow
preserved like a butterfly in amber. She had to be alive inside there,
under some kind of enchanted sleep. What kind of curse or magic could
do such a thing? And why? Some kind of prison for enemies? And how long
had she been frozen like this? The temple had been abandoned almost a
thousand years ago.</p>
<p>He stood, staring at it for a long time,
trying to sort out what he was feeling about seeing this thing. In his
experience he had seen countless things that people would have
considered unnatural, but such a spectacle still unnerved him. The
closer Corsten approached the strange crystal with its pulsing light,
the more uneasy he began to feel about being under its gaze &mdash; and yet
he couldn't stop himself from moving closer to it.</p>
<p>Almost without thinking, he stepped into
the pool that surrounded it. As he did so, he noticed that a peculiar
sound seemed to emanate from the direction of the crystal; barely
audible, and almost musical in nature. He waded nearer to the platform,
and the surface of the shallow pool reflected the unearthly glow,
illuminating his face and body. He approached the foot of the platform
and stopped, peering around for any threats. Seeing none, he ascended
the steps and approached the crystal. It was clear like glass, but with
a deeper blue-green hue than he'd ever seen before. It shone with an
inner light, and while the surface was smooth it had a quality that
hinted at depths he could not see. He knelt before it and looked up at
the woman inside. Her face remained serene, almost ethereal in its
inner peace.</p>
<p>She was like a princess under a spell,
waiting for a hero to come and free her. Corsten's heart ached to be
that hero, and yet he knew he was not worthy to fulfil that role. He
was no hero. He was a restless wanderer with a troubled past and
uncertain future, adrift in a world that was not his own.</p>
<p>He had been forced to leave so many
behind, back in the land of his birth. Friends and kin whom he would
never see again. If they'd known what he was going to face, perhaps
they would have shown mercy and allowed him to stay, or decided that
they needed him more than the outside world did.</p>
<p>It was too late for all of that now. Too
much time had passed; too many bridges burned. All that mattered now
was finding what he needed to build a new home for himself.</p>
<p>But what was here for him? There was
nothing in this room but the crystal, the girl inside it, and sorcery
beyond his ability to comprehend. How could he hope to undo a spell
that had survived the ages since this place had been forsaken? But,
then, if he could not, then why had the Chaos Lord drawn him here?</p>
<p>He took another moment to admire her
beauty, feeling a stirring of passion deep within him as his eyes
followed the curves of her body. She was wearing a simple gown of some
sort of silky material, hugging her form, clinging to her body as if it
were part of it and leaving little to Corsten's imagination. The
pulsing light from the massive crystal accentuated every curve of the
maiden's beautiful form, outlining cheek and breast and thigh.</p>
<p>Corsten felt a distant twinge of guilt
at this thought. He shook his head. No. This was neither the time nor
the place for such thoughts. He forced himself to take a more objective
view of her physical condition. For now he needed to focus on figuring
out how to free her from the crystal without harm, and that would be
difficult enough without getting distracted by urges best left
unfulfilled.</p>
<p>Corsten turned around and looked over
the rest of the chamber again, looking for anything he might be able to
use to help free her. The walls bore nothing but decorative imagery
similar to those on the outside of the ruin, but more elaborate and
with more variation in themes. There were more frescoes, with many
different scenes depicted &mdash; landscapes, battles, celebrations,
religious ceremonies &mdash; but none depicted a scene such as was displayed
in front of him, nor how to undo it. He could see nothing at all useful
in the room other than the platform she was frozen in.</p>
<p>He knelt and examined the crystal,
looking for seams or joints around her feet or waist, but it was solid
all around her. He considered using his tools to chisel away at the
crystal &mdash; but doubts crept into his mind. He could not be certain that
damaging it in such a way would not cause her to shatter along with it,
and he was not willing to risk this girl's life by attacking the
problem with brute force. He had already learned that lesson. Such a
thing would be worse than doing nothing, and leaving her to this cold
isolation.</p>
<p><em><span class="s2">I know not who you are,</span></em> Corsten
silently told her, <em><span class="s2">but I feel your
sadness in the air around you. And I... I will never be the hero that I
wish to be. I am not meant for greatness. I am a fool, just like all
men before me. A fool to think that I can ever be anything else.</span></em></p>
<p>His soul gripped by a profound
melancholy, Corsten took one final step closer and placed his hand
against the crystal. Its surface was cool and unyielding beneath his
palm.</p>
<p>The musical tones were louder now, and
they sounded beautiful, like the song of birds, but unlike any birds he
had ever heard before. Corsten felt a chill in his heart. He had the
feeling that all of time was at a standstill &mdash; that this moment was no
longer a part of it.</p>
<p>In the pouch at his belt, he felt a
sudden movement. The place where he had stowed the small agate figurine
was wriggling and squirming within its confines like a teeming mass of
worms. He glanced down in alarm, but his attention was immediately
arrested by a sharp tingling in the fingers that pressed against the
glassy surface, as if they were asleep. Then there was a change in the
emanations of the crystalline light. The hazy azure glow grew more
intense, and his fingertips began to ache and throb painfully. He tried
to snatch his hand back, but it would not come away from the crystal.
As he stared at it, the crystal began to emanate more light, until it
was burning with an intense white light.</p>
<p>What had begun as a subtle chill in his
hand was now spreading all over like cold fire, engulfing him
relentlessly with a freezing pain that would have made him collapse if
not for whatever force was keeping him upright. He cried out in agony,
clutching at his chest with his free hand as cold needles stabbed
through him.</p>
<p>Then all at once he realised there was
no pain anymore. His hand was free. He pulled it back, looking at it in
confusion, but it was unharmed.</p>
<p>Something fluttered down past him, and
he looked up. Petals of black and red were drifting down from on high
and landing around him on the dusty stone of the platform. The strange
birdlike musical sound was all around him now &mdash; chirps and flute-like
whistles &mdash; but there were no birds, only those petals drifting gently
through the air.</p>
<p>His eyes fell again on the crystal. It
was melting.</p>
